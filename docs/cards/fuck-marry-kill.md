## Physical Card Effect

> Choose a unicorn in any player's Stable to DESTROY, choose a player to SACRIFICE a card, and choose a player to GIVE a card from their hand.

The digital implementation reads the effect as a fixed sequence targeting the opponent:
1. Opponent discards 1 card from their hand (chosen by the opponent)
2. Active player gives 1 card from their hand to the opponent (chosen by the active player)
3. Active player destroys 1 card from any of the opponent's stables — unicorn, upgrade, or downgrade (chosen by the active player)

---

## Implementation

`FuckMarryKillCardData` extends `MagicCardData`, which sets:
- `cardType = MAGIC`
- `specialActionType = IMMEDIATE`

`OnEnable()` populates `actions` with three `CardAction` instances in sequence:

```
actions[0] = DiscardCardAction  { targetPlayer = Opponent, selectionMode = PlayerChooses, numberOfCards = 1 }
actions[1] = GiveCardAction     { giver = ActivePlayer, numberOfCards = 1 }
actions[2] = DestroyCardAction  { destroyer = ActivePlayer, numberOfCards = 1 }
```

### Execution flow

1. Player plays the card from `HandStable` → `CardManager.PlayCardForCurrentPlayer()` is called
2. Because `specialActionType == IMMEDIATE`, `CardManager` calls `card.cardData.TriggerSpecialAction(card)` before routing the card to the discard pile
3. `TriggerSpecialAction` → `CardActionExecutor.ExecuteActions(actions, sourceCard)`
4. Executor creates a `CardActionContext` (captures activePlayer, opponentPlayer, sourceCard, managers), enqueues all 3 actions, calls `ExecuteNextAction()`

All three steps below go through the same unified `CardActionExecutor.PromptPlayerToSelectCards(Player player, CardSpace source, CardSpace destination, int numberOfCards, PendingActionType actionType)` (introduced in the R4 refactor, replacing three near-identical `PromptPlayerToSelectAndDiscardCards`/`...GiveCards`/`...DestroyCards` methods this doc originally described).

**Step 1 — DiscardCardAction (opponent chooses):**
- `DiscardCardAction.Execute()` identifies `opponentPlayer.handStable` as the source
- `selectionMode == PlayerChooses` → calls `executor.PromptPlayerToSelectCards(opponentPlayer, handStable, discardPile, 1, PendingActionType.DiscardCard)`
- Executor saves `originalActivePlayer`, reassigns `turnManager.activePlayer = opponentPlayer`
- Sets `currentPendingAction = DiscardCard`, `pendingSourceStable = handStable`, `pendingCardsRemaining = 1`
- Queue is paused — waiting for the opponent to click a card

- Opponent clicks a card in their hand → `HandStable.HandleCardClick()` detects `currentPendingAction == DiscardCard`
- Calls `executor.ExecutePendingAction(card)` → `CardManager.MoveCard(card, handStable, discardPile)`
- `pendingCardsRemaining` hits 0 → `ClearPendingAction()` restores `originalActivePlayer`, calls `ExecuteNextAction()`

**Step 2 — GiveCardAction (active player chooses what to give):**
- `GiveCardAction.Execute()` identifies `activePlayer.handStable` as source, `opponentPlayer.handStable` as destination
- Calls `executor.PromptPlayerToSelectCards(activePlayer, handStable, opponentHandStable, 1, PendingActionType.GiveCard)`
- `turnManager.activePlayer` is reassigned to `activePlayer` (same player, no change in this case)
- Active player clicks a card in their hand → same `HandStable.HandleCardClick()` path with `GiveCard` pending type
- `MoveCard` moves the card to the opponent's hand

**Step 3 — DestroyCardAction (active player chooses any opponent card to destroy):**
- `DestroyCardAction.Execute()` with `destroyer = ActivePlayer`
- Determines target player = opponent (destroyer is active, so target is opponent)
- Counts cards across all three opponent stables; if all are empty, logs and skips
- Calls `executor.PromptPlayerToSelectCards(activePlayer, null, discardPile, 1, PendingActionType.DestroyCard)` — source is `null`; `pendingSourceStable` stays `null`, deferring source resolution to click time
- Sets `executor.pendingDestroyTargetPlayer = opponentPlayer` before prompting
- Active player clicks a card in any of the opponent's stables (`UnicornStable`, `UpgradeStable`, or `DowngradeStable`) → that stable's `HandleCardClick()` detects `DestroyCard` pending
- Guard: `Stable.HandleCardClick` checks `player == pendingDestroyTargetPlayer` → warns and returns if it doesn't match (can't destroy own cards, and more reliable than comparing against `turnManager.activePlayer`, which is reassigned mid-sequence)
- Otherwise: `executor.ExecutePendingAction(card)` resolves the source via `pendingSourceStable ?? card.cardSpace` and moves the card to the discardPile

After all 3 steps, `CardActionExecutor` queue is empty. `HandStable` then calls `turnManager.StartNextTurnPhase()` to advance the turn (this call is made in `HandStable.HandleCardClick` after `PlayCard()` returns successfully — before any pending action completes, but only once per card play). As of the EVERY_TURN mandatory/optional split, `HandStable.HandleCardClick` also checks whether a pending action is still open at that point and passes `SpecialActionType.NONE` instead of the card's real type if so, to avoid parking the turn in `ImmediateSpecial` when the effect hasn't actually finished synchronously — see `HandStable.cs` for the current logic.

## Quirks & Edge Cases

**The card routes to discard pile before effects resolve.** `CardManager.PlayCardForCurrentPlayer()` calls `TriggerSpecialAction` first, then moves the played card to the discard pile. This means the card is physically moved to the discard pile mid-effect, which is correct for Magic cards.

**GiveCardAction destination is always opponent's hand.** The physical card says "choose a player to give a card" — in a 2-player game this always means the opponent, which is how `GiveCardAction` currently resolves it (giver's hand → opponent's hand). This is correct for 2 players but will need a player-selection step for 3+ players.

**Turn phase advances before effects finish.** `HandStable.HandleCardClick` calls `turnManager.StartNextTurnPhase()` after `PlayCard()` returns `true`, which happens before the `CardActionExecutor` queue runs to completion. The turn phase advances immediately, but the card effect continues running as an overlay on top of the new phase. This works in practice because no CardSpace checks the turn phase during a pending action — but it's a latent ordering issue.

**Destroy step diverges slightly from the physical card.** The physical "Kill" wording is "destroy a unicorn." The current digital implementation generalises this to "destroy any card in any of the opponent's stables" — a deliberate simplification chosen when removing the `TargetStable` enum (B4). If the unicorn-only restriction is needed later, it should be restored as a per-action flag rather than re-introducing the enum.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Opponent's hand shrinks by 1 after Step 1
- [ ] Active player's hand shrinks by 1 after Step 2; opponent's hand grows by 1
- [ ] Step 3 accepts a click on any of the opponent's three stables (unicorn/upgrade/downgrade); the clicked stable shrinks by 1 and discardPile grows by 1
- [ ] Cannot select own cards during destroy step (warning fires correctly for each opponent stable)
- [ ] Turn advances to next phase after effect resolves
- [ ] Playing FMK when opponent has 0 cards in hand — Step 1 should log and skip gracefully
